It supports planners in designing and operating district heating (DH) systems with a high degree of technical and economic detail by optimising both dispatch schedules and investment decisions at an hourly resolution. This module enables users to assess how best to meet a region\u2019s DH demand through a mix of supply technologies, including combined heat and power (CHP) plants, boilers, heat pumps, waste-to-energy units, solar thermal collectors, and sources of excess heat. Depending on user needs, the module offers two modes of operation:</p> <ul> <li>Dispatch Only: Optimises the hourly operation of existing supply capacities to minimise operating costs, considering fuel, electricity, and CO\u2082 expenses, as well as technical constraints like network temperature limits.</li> <li>Investment + Dispatch: Simultaneously optimises capacity expansions and dispatch operations, identifying new investments needed to meet demand at the lowest total cost over a given planning horizon.</li> </ul> <p>The District Heating Supply CM supports flexible user inputs, allowing customisation of parameters such as capital expenditures (CAPEX), operational expenditures (OPEX), system efficiencies, component lifetimes, CO\u2082 pricing, electricity market prices, and interest rates. It produces a range of primary outputs, including optimal dispatch schedules, capacity investment recommendations, the levelized cost of heat (LCOH), full annual cost breakdowns, energy generation volumes, CO\u2082 emissions, and technology shares in both investment and dispatch.</p> <p>Figure - The Concept of DH Suppy Module </p> <p></p> <p>Please note that the version embedded in the SAPHEA platform represents a simplified concept compared to the more comprehensive stand-alone version of the module.

The basic components of a compression heat pump* include an evaporator, compressor, condenser, and expansion valve, as shown in the process flow diagram in Figure - Working Principle Heat Pump. In the evaporator, heat is absorbed from the geothermal brine, causing the refrigerant to evaporate. The vapor is then compressed, which increases both temperature and pressure. In the condenser, the heat is transferred to the heat sink, for example, a district heating network (DHN), before the refrigerant is expanded and the cycle repeats. The simplified T-s diagram illustrates the thermodynamic processes of evaporation, compression, condensation, and expansion. The Sankey diagram in Figure - Working Principle Heat Pump further highlights the energy flows, demonstrating that only a relatively small amount of electrical energy is needed to transfer a much larger amount of thermal energy.</p> <p>Figure - Working Principle Heat Pump</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The performance of a compression heat pump is characterised by the coefficient of performance (COP), which is the ratio between the useful heat output, thus, the heat supplied to the DHN, and the required input to drive the heat pump, which is the electricity demand of the compressor. Therefore, a COP of e.g. 4 means that by using 1 kWh of electricity, 4 kWh of useful heat at a sufficiently high temperature level can be supplied. Consequently, the higher the COP is, the lower your operational costs (caused by the electricity consumption). However, due to the laws of thermodynamics, the theoretically achievable COP depends on the temperature lift of the heat pump; thus, the difference between the cold temperature source, which is used as an energy source for driving the heat pump and the temperature sink (e.g. the DHN). The higher the temperature lift, the lower the theoretical achievable COP, as shown in Figure - Heat pump Coefficient of Performance (COP). In theory, the so-called Carnot COP represents the theoretical upper limit of the COP; however, in reality, actual heat pumps can achieve a COP of e.g 0.4 to 0.5 of the Carnot COP. </p> <p>Figure - Heat pump Coefficient of Performance (COP)</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Next to compression heat pumps, also absorption heat pumps and absorption heat transformers are a promising technological concept. Those absorption systems use heat to drive the system, resulting in a significantly lower power demand. Nevertheless, due to the industry's strong focus on compression heat pumps, this section only addresses those systems.</p>"},{"location":"cm-large-scale-geothermal-heat-pump/#large-scale-heat-pumps-in-the-context-of-geothermal-projects","title":"Large-scale heat pumps in the context of geothermal projects","text":"<p>As shown in Figure - Geothermal Scenarios , large-scale heat pumps can be applied for two purposes: </p> <ul> <li>Either increasing the thermal capacity of a geothermal heating project </li> <li>or enabling the utilisation of insufficient low geothermal production temperatures. </li> </ul> <p>Direct use without heat pump: In the first scenario, the geothermal brine is produced at a sufficiently high temperature (around 110\u202f\u00b0C) to directly supply the district heating network (DHN) at the required temperature (e.g., 105\u202f\u00b0C). After transferring heat to the DHN, the cooled brine is reinjected into the reservoir. This setup is highly efficient and straightforward, as it does not require any additional boosting technologies. However, it is only feasible when the geothermal source consistently delivers high production temperatures.</p> <p>Capacity increase with the heat pump: In the second scenario, the geothermal production temperature remains high, but a high-temperature heat pump (HTHP) is added to increase the total heat extraction from the geothermal source. After direct heat transfer to the DHN, the cooled brine, which still contains usable thermal energy, is further cooled by the heat pump. The heat pump upgrades this remaining lower-temperature heat, thus increasing the overall capacity of the system without needing to drill additional wells or increase flow rates.</p> <p>Utilization of low production temperatures with the heat pump: In the third scenario, the geothermal production temperature is too low (e.g., 85\u201390\u202f\u00b0C) to directly supply the DHN at the required temperature. Therefore, a high-temperature heat pump is essential to upgrade the geothermal heat to DHN supply conditions. The heat pump extracts energy from the moderately warm geothermal brine and boosts it to meet the DHN supply temperature requirements.
